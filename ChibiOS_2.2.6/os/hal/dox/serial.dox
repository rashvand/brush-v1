/**
 * @defgroup SERIAL Serial Driver
 * @brief Generic Serial Driver.
 * @details This module implements a generic full duplex serial driver. The
 * driver implements a @p SerialDriver interface and uses I/O Queues for
 * communication between the upper and the lower driver. Event flags are used
 * to notify the application about incoming data, outgoing data and other I/O
 * events.<br>
 * The  module also contains functions that make the implementation of the
 * interrupt service routines much easier.
 * @pre     In order to use the SERIAL driver the @p HAL_USE_SERIAL option
 *          must be enabled in @p halconf.h.
 *
 * @ingroup IO
